# SetUp

Setup is a social media based on the bubble of interests between users, that create a post generation separated by interests tags chosen by the user in the registration form.

## Implemented features

### Make a new post
Any user can create a post since he logged in. The post can be only text or contain one image.

### Like post
Every post will have a like button accessible for all users can interact, for each click of like the user who gives will get 1xp.

### Up Vote
Different from like, one Up Vote cost 200 Up Coins. The Up Vote feature is focused on donating coins and boosting the post on platform reach, the post creator will gain 150 coins of each Up Vote, and the other 50 coins will be directed to the platform as a fee.

### Up Coin
Up Coin is the platform value used to create an ecosystem of interaction on each post, because the coins will flow between the users, encouraging to the users make new interesting to get coins to direct them to their favorite creators. Users can add Up Coins on their profile paying for recharges, now the only payment method implemented is Paypal.

### Share post
Users can share posts created by another's users, but the post will only be listed on his profile, not in the main dashboard feed and the Up Voted made on the shared post will be redirected to the original post creator.

### Xp levels
The user's profiles show the current level and xp amount, and on all interactions between users generate xp on different values. When some levels are reached the user will receive an achievement and he will be displayed on the user public profile.

### Achievements
On the profile page in the level section, all user's achievements will be shown. The achievements are variated since the first post made or first upvoted clicked.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
